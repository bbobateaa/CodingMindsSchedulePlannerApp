This app uses Flutter, Dart language and Firebase's realtime data base and authentication system. It is a simple app to help user make a schedule plan with a added time, title, and description which they are able to view in the home page. All user data is saved to a database and user can make multiple accounts with a valid email. The user cannot make a account with a invalid email address since firebase will authenticate it first before the app creates the new account and adding it to the database.
